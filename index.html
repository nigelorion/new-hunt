        <h1>A HUNT STORY:</h1>

        <p><strong>Harvey Gorsuch</strong>, Owner/Founder of HUNT, began developing his style over sixty-four years ago as a ten year old living in Ferndale, Washington. After spending a summer picking strawberries, he spent his entire wages ($23.00) on three sets of underwear, socks, and an orange and white vertical striped shirt at Kean's Department Store.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to the 70's and 80's, where Harvey found himself living in Bellingham but frequently traveling to Seattle to hunt for treasures in menswear thrift shops.  His passion for the pursuit of high quality clothing and enthusiasm for menswear resale set him on the path to owning his own shop.</p>

        <p>In December of 2016, Harvey opened <strong>HUNT Gentlemen's Resale</strong> on Edmunds Street in the vibrant neighborhood of Columbia City. <strong>HUNT</strong> has since become a destination shop in the evolving style scene of Seattle. Located in the Shirley Marvin Hotel Annex, HUNT is a “tiny house” boutique with a cozy arrangement of high end goods.</p>
