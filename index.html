      <h1>A HUNT STORY:</h1>

<p>Harvey Gorsuch, Owner/Founder of HUNT, began developing his style over sixty-four years ago as a ten year old living in Ferndale, Washington. After spending a summer picking strawberries, he spent his entire wages ($23.00) on three sets of underwear, socks, and an orange and white vertical striped shirt at Kean’s Department Store.</p>

<p>Harvey’s early appreciation for an investment in personal style led to his frequent trips in the 70’s and 80’s from his home in Bellingham to a men’s thrift store in Seattle on Madison Avenue. His love of the hunt for treasures and enthusiasm for menswear resale set him on the path to owning his own shop.</p>

<p>In December of 2016, Harvey opened HUNT Gentlemen’s Resale on Edmunds Street in the vibrant neighborhood of Columbia City. HUNT has since become a destination shop in the evolving style scene of Seattle. Located in the Shirley Marvin Hotel Annex, HUNT is a “tiny house” boutique with a cozy arrangement of high end goods.</p>
